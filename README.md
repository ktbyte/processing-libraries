# processing-libraries
Processing Libraries and Classes designed to work on both [Processing](https://processing.org) and [KTBYTE CODER](https://www.ktbyte.com/coder)

Please see the RegisterMethodExample.pde file for an example of how to automatically call methods in your classes after void draw(), or after keyboard/mouse events.
